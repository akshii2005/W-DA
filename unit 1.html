<h2>(1) HISTORY OF WWW </h2> 
<p> Tim Berners-Lee, a British scientist, invented the World Wide Web (WWW) in 1989, while working at CERN. The Web was originally conceived and developed to meet the demand for automated information-sharing between scientists in universities and institutes around the world. </p>
<p> The WWW design allowed easy access to existing information  It included the ‘line-mode’ browser, Web server software and a library for developers. In March 1991, the software became available to colleagues using CERN computers. A few months later, in August 1991, he announced the WWW software on Internet newsgroups and interest in the project spread around the world.</p>
<h2) (2) EVOLUTION OF HTML </h2> 
<p> The first version of HTML was written by Tim Berners-Lee in 1993. Since then, there have been many different versions of HTML. The most widely used version throughout the 2000's was HTML 4.01, which became an official standard in December 1999. HTML 4.01 was published in late 1999 and was a major version of HTML.</p>
 HTML 1.0 was released in 1993 with the intention of sharing information that can be readable and accessible via web browsers. But not many of the developers were involved in creating websites. So the language was also not growing. <br>
 Then comes HTML 2.0, published in 1995, which contains all the features of HTML 1.0 along with a few additional features, which remained the standard markup language for designing and creating websites until January 1997 and refined various core features of HTML. <br>
 Then comes HTML 3.0, where Dave Raggett introduced a fresh paper or draft on HTML. It included improved new features of HTML, giving more powerful characteristics for webmasters in designing web pages. But these powerful features of the new HTML slowed down the browser in applying further improvements. <br>
 Then comes HTML 4.01, which is widely used and was a successful version of HTML before HTML 5.0, which is currently released and used worldwide. HTML 5 can be said for an extended version of HTML 4.01, which was published in the year 2012. </p>

 <h2> (4) Why HTML 5 ? </h2> 
 <p> HTML 5 is the latest version of HTML which is the core markup language of the World Wide Web that can be written in both HTML (HTML 5) and XML (XHTML 5) language. </p> 
 <p> HTML 5 allows utilizing new structural elements and attributes, replacing some of the familiar elements. Moreover it’s providing some fresh functionality like audio and video elements which will offer an easy way to semantically structure the page. <br> 
 HTML 5 is developed to grant the developers a means to build up more flexible, powerful and efficient applications. It overcomes the lacking issues related to HTML 4 and brings in many new tags and enhancements for a broad range of features including form controls, APIs, multimedia, structure, database support and faster processing. </p> 
<p> <ul>Following are the new APIs included in HTML 5: <br>
<li>Offline storage database</li> <br>
<li>Geo-Location</li><br>
<li>Document editing </li><br> 
<li>Drag-and-drop </li><br> 
<li>Cross-document messaging </li><br> 
<li>MIME type and protocol handler registration</li> <br>
<li>Browser history management </li><br>
<li>Indexed hierarchical key-value store </li><br>
<li>Microdata </li><br> 
<li>Local and Web SQL Database</li> <br>
<li>Timed media playback </li><br>
<li>Indexed Database API</li> <br> 
<li>Direct HTML Support for Drawing, Animation, Video and Audio</li> </ul></p>

<h2> (6) HTML5 New Features </h2>
 <p> <ul> Here’s a list of Top 12 HTML5 Features, which are explained in detail below: </p>
<p> <li> Semantic Elements </li> <br>
<li> Audio and Video Support </li> <br> 
<li> Canvas Elements </li> <br> 
<li> Geolocation API </li> <br>
<li> Local Storage </li> <br>
<li> Responsive Images </li> <br> 
<li> Web Workers </li> <br> 
<li> Drag and Drop API </li> <br>
<li> Form Enhancements </li> <br>
<li> Web Sockets </li> <br> </ul> 
<h2> (7) Browser Suport </h2>
<p> HTML5 is supported in all modern browsers. <br>
In addition, all browsers, old and new, automatically handle unrecognized elements as inline elements. <br>
Because of this, you can "teach" older browsers to handle "unknown" HTML elements. <br> 
HTML5 is supported by all the major browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera, as well as iOS for Chrome and Safari and Android browsers. </p>
<h2> (8) Backward Compatibility </h2>
<p> HTML5 is designed, as much as possible, to be backward compatible with existing all major web browsers. New features build on existing features and allow you to provide fallback content for older browsers. It is suggested to detect support for individual HTML5 features using a few lines of JavaScript. </p>

<h2> (1) Creating DOM </h2>
<p> When a web page is loaded, the browser creates a Document Object Model of the page.<br>
The HTML DOM model is constructed as a tree of Objects: <br>
To create a DOM element, you use the createElement() method.<br>
const element = document.createElement(htmlTag);<br>
Firstly, bytes are converted to HTML characters and then to Tokens. In the next step, Tokens are converted into nodes. Nodes are different objects with certain properties. After the nodes are created, the DOM tree is created. </p>
<h2> (2) Doctype Character Encoding </h2>
<p> . For the HTML syntax of HTML5, setting the character encoding is done by using a meta element with a charset attribute that specifies the encoding within the first 1024 bytes of the document. <br> 
An encoding defines a mapping between bytes and text. A sequence of bytes allows for different textual interpretations. By specifying a particular encoding (such as UTF-8), we specify how the sequence of bytes is to be interpreted.<br>
For example, in HTML we normally declare a character encoding of UTF-8, using the following line: <br>
< meta charset="utf-8" /> </p>
<h2> (3) Deprecated Elements </h2>
<p> A deprecated element or attribute is one that has been outdated by newer constructs. Deprecated elements are defined in the reference manual in appropriate locations, but are clearly marked as deprecated. Deprecated elements may become obsolete in future versions of HTML.<br>
deprecated elements are those elements that are allowed, but not recommended and are being replaced by newer ones. So, a "deprecated code" means that it is not recommended to use as there is a better alternative in that software to use instead. </p>
<h2> (4) HTML Document </h2>
<p> An HTML document is a file containing hypertext markup language. HTML code is based on tags, or hidden keywords, which provide instructions for formatting the document. A tag starts with an angle bracket and the 'less than' sign: '<'. The tag ends with an angle bracket and the 'greater than' sign '>'. </p> 
<h2> (5) Section Tag </h2> 
<p> The < section> tag defines a section in a document. <br> 
It is a structural HTML element used to group together related elements. Each < section> typically includes one or more heading elements and additional elements presenting related content. Display block Usage semantic | structural. </p> 
<p> for example: <br>
< section> <br>
< h2>WWF History< /h2> <br> 
< p>The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) is an international organization working on issues regarding the cons ervation, research and restoration of the environment, formerly named the World Wildlife Fund. WWF was founded in 1961.< /p><br>

<h2> (6) Article Tag </h2>

<h2> (7) Aside Tag </h2>

<h2> (10) Nav Tag </h2>

  < a href="/html/">HTML< /a>  <br>
  < a href="/css/">CSS< /a>  <br>
